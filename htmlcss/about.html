Steadfast Gaming was founded in 2020, when the owner of the server ended his internship with Victory point, they had a decent amount of finnish players at that time, enough to play with
in a finnish tournament hosted by Assembly, this was around autumn of 2022.<br>
Sam got the actual idea to start the organization when he used to work at a console renting company, when covid hit in Finland, nobody really came in during the pandemic, since the Managment wasnt excellent as he told Sam
to just get Kebabs for lunch and do nothing pretty much, he felt lonely working there so that's when he also started getting into playing league, and then he had the idea to start the organization.<br>
When Sam assembled a team they started playing in Assembly as "Team Victory Point."<br>
The very first logo looked like this.<br><img src="watermark_sf2.png" class="bilde"><br>
The organization went through a lot,internal issues, fights with different people at different times, but Sam just went on with everything, and left it in the past, and that's when he made a friend
who just so happened to make logos, and he made the team a new logo, which was an upgrade from the old one.<br>

The last 2 years both Sam and Steadfast Gaming has grown a lot physically and mentally, and now Sam wanting to make this organization a lot more serious rather than just a casual gig,
since then not only the organization itself has been growing but also the quality of logos, and teams, the new logo being made by the same friend Sam met.<br>
